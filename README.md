Information Retrieval System

## Description

This application is an Information Retrieval System that allows users to perform text-based searches and retrieve relevant documents. It provides the following functionalities:

1. Tokenization: The application tokenizes input documents, breaking them down into individual words or tokens.
2. Stop Word Removal: Common stop words like "in," "to," and "where" are removed from the tokenized documents to improve search accuracy.
3. Positional Indexing: The application builds a positional index, which maps each term to the documents and their positions where the term appears.
4. Query Processing: Users can enter queries, and the application retrieves documents based on the query terms using the positional index.
5. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Calculation: The application calculates the TF-IDF values for the terms in the documents, which reflect the importance of a term in a document relative to the entire corpus.
6. Cosine Similarity Scoring: The application computes cosine similarity scores between the user query and the documents, providing a measure of relevance.
7. User Interface: The application provides a command-line interface where users can interact with the system by entering queries and receiving relevant document results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Place your text files in the 'files' directory.
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`.
3. Enter your query when prompted.
4. The system will output the positional index, query results, TF-IDF calculations, and cosine similarity scores.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- nltk
- natsort
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the system:

1. Place your text files in the 'files' directory.
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`.
3. Enter your query: "antony caeser".
4. The system will display the query results, TF-IDF calculations, and cosine similarity scores.
